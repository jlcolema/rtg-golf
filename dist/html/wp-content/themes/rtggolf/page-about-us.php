	Tom Kozlak

	Partner

	RTG Golf is a second career for me. In 1999, after 25 years in the restaurant business I decided I wanted to explore a second career. Still at it 20 years later.

	In that 20 years I have “researched” golf all over the world and have gained the expertise to create great golf itineraries domestically and internationally.
