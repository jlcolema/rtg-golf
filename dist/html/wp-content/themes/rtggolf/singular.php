			<p>RTG golf traveled with a small group of golfers in August of 2019. Most of the travelers are veterans of several trips to Ireland & Scotland having played most of the courses that grab the headlines.</p>

			<p>This trip was designed to play a couple of the big names as well as get off the beaten path. Total success on both initiatives. The group loved Ailsa at Turnberry, Dundonald Links and Western Gailesâ€“but the trip became memorable once we ventured further west from the Ayrshire coast.</p>

			<p>We took the long and winding road (yes, the one of Beatles lore) to the tiny village of Machrihanish located in the shadow of Campbeltown.</p>
